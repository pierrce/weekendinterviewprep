# Weekend VR Project


## About

I'm going to be doing a weekend VR project to present at an interview I have Monday. Everything within this project will be made by me. Including: models, particle systems, animations, scripts, and VR interaction systems. Anything that is not made by me will be listed down below as dependencies.

### VRTK

For time saving purposes, I'm going to be using [VRTK](https://vrtoolkit.readme.io/) for the movement and interactions within Virtual Space. 

### Textures

All custom textures will be from [textures.com](https://textures.com/). The materials will be made by myself within Unity with these textures. Normal maps will be created by myself using a Paint.net normalizer plugin.
